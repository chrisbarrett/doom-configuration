#+title: Doom Configuration

This is my personal Emacs configuration, written as a set of Doom modules. I use
a mix of the modules provided by Doom and my own.

In cases where my settings diverge from Doom's defaults, I will typically use
the module provided by Doom and write another module to override the defaults.
